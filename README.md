# Data Structures Implementation

Welcome to the Data Structures Implementation repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in both C and C++. Each data structure comes with detailed explanations and examples to help you understand how they work and how to use them effectively in your projects.

## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks of software applications. Understanding and implementing these data structures are essential for writing efficient and maintainable code. This repository aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical usage by providing real-world implementations of common data structures.

## Implemented Data Structures

Here is a list of data structures currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Singly Linked List (C)**: A linear data structure where each element points to the next element in the list.
2. **Doubly Linked List (C)**: A linear data structure with elements that point both to the next and the previous elements.
3. **Stack (C)**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that follows the "push" and "pop" operations.
4. **Queue (C)**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that follows the "enqueue" and "dequeue" operations.
5. **Binary Search Tree (C++)**: A binary tree with left child elements smaller and right child elements greater than the parent.
6. **AVL Tree (C++)**: A self-balancing binary search tree to maintain logarithmic height and efficient operations.
7. **Heap (C++)**: A binary tree-based data structure that maintains the heap property.
8. **Hash Table (C++)**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to improve data retrieval.
9. **Graph (C++)**: A non-linear data structure comprising nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

Each data structure folder contains detailed explanations, implementation files, and header files for easy integration into your projects. The accompanying examples demonstrate the usage of these data structures to solve practical problems.

## Usage

To incorporate any of the implemented data structures into your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-implementation.git

1. **Navigate to the Data Structure**: Browse to the desired data structure's folder (e.g., `stack-c`, `binary-search-tree-cpp`).
2. **Include the Header Files**: Integrate the necessary header files into your C or C++ source code.
3. **Start Using the Data Structure**: Utilize the data structure functions as demonstrated in the accompanying examples. You can create instances of the data structures and call their respective methods to manipulate the data.

Remember to compile your code with the appropriate C/C++ compiler and linker flags to use the data structures successfully.

## Updating with Algorithm Problems

In addition to data structures, this repository will be continuously updated with algorithm problems that leverage the implemented data structures. Each problem will be well-documented, and appropriate labels will help you identify the data structures used in each problem.
